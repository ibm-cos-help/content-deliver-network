# Purge Cached Content for a CDN Account

Outdated content for a CDN Account may be purged manually from all Points of Presence (POPs) so that updated content may be propagated for view when content is next requested. Upon requesting a purge, content is removed from all POPs and must be manually propagated for a content update. Purges take approximately 3-5 minutes to complete. Follow the steps below to purge content from the CDN.

## Purge Cached Content

1. Access the CDN interface. Refer to [Access the CDN Screen](access-cdn-screen.html).
2. Click the **Account ID** for the desired CDN Account to access the account.
3. Click the **Cache Management** tab.
4. Enter up to 15 URLs in the **Content URL(s)** field.
5. Click the **Purge** button to purge cached content from the specified URL(s).
