# Getting Started with Storage CDN

The CloudLayer Content Delivery Network (CDN) is IBM Cloudâ€™s legacy solution for organizing, storing and streaming content on the web with optimized flow of content to end-users.  CDN allows users to deliver content that requires large transfer rates through a streamlined process of caching and delivery to ensure the quickest delivery possible.  CDN can be used in a variety of businesses, including social networking, entertainment, media, software, broadcast, e-banking and e-commerce websites.
