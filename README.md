# content-delivery-network

The CloudLayer Content Delivery Network (CDN) is IBM Cloudâ€™s legacy solution for organizing, storing and streaming content on the web with optimized flow of content to end-users. Storage CDN allows users to deliver content that requires large transfer rates through a streamlined process of caching and delivery to ensure the quickest delivery possible. CDN can be used in a variety of businesses, including social networking, entertainment, media, software, broadcast, e-banking and e-commerce websites.

This collection belonged to the Storage tribe and is now depricated. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this offering, please contact Viktoria Muirhead, Information Developer (viktoria.muirhead@ibm.com).
